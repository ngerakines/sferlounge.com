SF Erlounge, hosted by Powerset/Microsoft

The next SF Erlounge is just around the corner thanks to Powerset/Microsoft
for providing the space. The event is open to the public. Erlang developers,
functional programming folks and the curious are welcome to this social event.
Light food and drinks will be provided.

We will be deviating slightly by having a round of presentations.
