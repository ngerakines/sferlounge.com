<p>The next SF Erlounge is just around the corner thanks to
Powerset/Microsoft for providing the space. The event is open to the
public. Erlang developers, functional programming folks and the
curious are welcome to this social event. Light food and drinks will
be provided. There isn't a set agenda so please let me know if you'd
like to present.</p>
