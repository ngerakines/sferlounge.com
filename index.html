<p>Friday, December 11th, 2009 from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that LinkedIn is hosting the next San Francisco Erlounge in Mountain View.  The event is open to the public.  Erlang developers, functional programming folks and the curious are welcome to this social event.  Light food and drinks will be provided. There isn't a set agenda so please let me know if you'd like to present. Otherwise, we'll go over the EUC slides and presentation and host a related discussion.</p>
<pre>    LinkedIn Corporation
    2027 Stierlin Court
    Mountain View, CA 94043</pre>
<p>As always, we greatly appreciate it when you RSVP.  Please direct any questions or comments to nick+sferlounge@gerakines.net.  I can also be reached on my mobile phone, +1 (415) 963-1165.  There is ample parking in and around the area.</p>
<p>If you plan on attending from the city, please consider carpooling or taking caltrain because traffic around 5:30pm / 6:00pm isn't so fun.  I'll make myself available to help people get to and from caltrain if needed, but please let me know ahead of time so I can schedule accordingly.</p>
